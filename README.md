# Skin Disease Detection App  

A mobile application for **skin disease detection** powered by **deep learning (CNN)** and **TensorFlow Lite**. The app enables users to capture or upload skin images, processes them locally on their device, and provides classification results in real-time. This project demonstrates how AI can assist in **early disease awareness** and support **dermatology workflows**.  

## Features  
-  **Mobile-ready**: Built with TensorFlow Lite for lightweight and efficient performance.  
-  **Deep Learning**: CNN-based model trained to detect and classify common skin diseases.  
-  **Real-time Inference**: Fast on-device predictions without requiring internet connectivity.  
-  **Image Input**: Upload images from gallery or capture live through the camera.  
-  **Privacy First**: All inference runs locally on the user’s device.  

## Detected Classes  
The model is trained to classify the following **7 skin diseases**:  
- Acne  
- Dermatofibroma  
- Eczema  
- Melanoma  
- Psoriasis  
- Scabies  
- Solar Lentigo  

## Tech Stack  
- **TensorFlow & TensorFlow Lite** – Model training and mobile deployment.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** – For skin disease classification.  
- **Flutter** – Mobile application frontend.
